This guide will explain how to use Ory Keto's expand-API to display who has
access to an object, and why. Please refer to the
[gRPC](../reference/proto-api.mdx) and [REST](../reference/rest-api.mdx) API
reference documentation for all details. In general, the expand-API allows to
expand a given subject set into all its effective subjects.

## Example

As an example, we want to look at a file sharing application. Files are
hierarchically organized in a directory structure. Every user owns files and
directories, and can grant any other user access to them on a per-file or
per-directory basis. Users can only see and access files they own or were
granted access by the owner.

Directories and files are stored in Ory Keto within the `directories` and
`files` namespaces respectively. They are identified by a UUID that the
application maps to the actual object metadata. Users are also identified by and
mapped to a UUID.

:::info

For the sake of readability, the code samples use the object path and user name
instead. Please refer to the [objects](../concepts/objects.mdx) and
[subjects](../concepts/subjects.mdx) pages for why the mapping is necessary.

### Displaying who has Access

To assist users with managing permissions for their files, the application has
to display exactly who has access to a file and why. In this example, we assume
that the application knows the following files and directories:

```
├─ photos            (owner: maureen; shared with laura)
   ├─ beach.jpg      (owner: maureen)
   ├─ mountains.jpg  (owner: laura)
```

This is represented in Ory Keto by the following
[relation tuples](../concepts/relation-tuples.mdx):

```keto-relation-tuples
// ownership
directories:/photos#owner@maureen
files:/photos/beach.jpg#owner@maureen
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#owner@laura

// maureen granted access to /photos to laura
directories:/photos#access@laura

// the following tuples are defined implicitly through subject set rewrites (not supported yet)
directories:/photos#access@(directories:/photos#owner)
files:/photos/beach.jpg#access@(files:/photos/beach.jpg#owner)
files:/photos/beach.jpg#access@(directories:/photos#access)
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#access@(files:/photos/mountains.jpg#owner)
files:/photos/mountains.jpg#access@(directories:/photos#access)

// the follwoing tuples are required to allow the subject set rewrites (not supported yet)
directories:/photos#parent@(files:/photos/beach.jpg#_)
directories:/photos#parent@(files:/photos/mountains.jpg#_)
```

The user `maureen` now wants to manage `access` for the file
`/photos/beach.jpg`. Therefore, the application uses the expand-API to get a
tree of everyone who has access to that file:

<CodeTabs
  sampleId="expand-api-display-access/01-expand-beach"
  version="v0.6.0-alpha.1.pre.6"
/>

### Maximum Tree Depth

The `max-depth` parameter is important to keep the request latency within an
acceptable bound, but also abstract away the most basic subject sets. In many
cases the application does not want to resolve all subject sets, but rather
wants to display that e.g. `Everyone in the company` or `Admins` have a specific
relation.

In this example the application knows the rough structure of the relation tuples
it uses and can therefore determine that `max-depth=3` is sufficient to display
all relevant relations:

1. directly granted access (depth 1)
2. indirectly granted access through ownership (depth 2)
3. indirectly granted access through ownership of the parent (depth 3)

### Analyzing the Tree

The tree does not only include the subject IDs (in this case usernames), but
also for what reason they were included. This can be useful for users to audits
permissions. Also, in many cases the application would not want to list all
subject IDs but rather abstract away some subject sets.
