title: Implemented and Planned Features
---

In October 2020 we decided to rewrite Ory Keto from scratch, implementing
state-of-the-art access control and permissions. We decided to make Ory Keto the
first Open Source implementation of
[Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/).

This document gives an overview of all implemented and planned features.
Unfortunately we cannot give delivery time estimates for Open Source products,
but you can help us to accelerate development by
[supporting Ory](https://opencollective.com/ory).
