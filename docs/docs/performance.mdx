This document explains the time complexity of Ory Keto. Main memory complexity
will be analyzed and added at a later point. We only examine the evaluation
engines (check and expand API) as all other parts are mainly determined by
dependencies like your database of choice, or the de-/encoding of messages.
Examples given omit the namespace for clarity.

## Check Engine

In essence, the check-engine assumes that the relation tuples and their
indirections assemble an acyclic directed graph, known as
[the graph of relations](concepts/graph-of-relations).

Consider the following example:

```keto-relation-tuples
file#access@(file#owner)       // probably defined via subjectset rewrites
file#access@user1              // access was granted directly
file#owner@user2               // file owner record; indirectly gets access
```

This is interpreted as the following graph:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
graph TD
    A[file] -->|access| B{{file#owner}}
    A -->|owner| C([user2])
    A -->|access| D([user1])
    B -. file#access .-> C
`}
/>

A check request of the form `object#relation@user` will be evaluated by
searching the graph starting at `object` going through `relation` trying to
reach `user`. The request is allowed iff there is such a path.

The algorithm used in Ory Keto for this graph traversal is breadth-first search.
In the worst case it has a time complexity of `O(n+e)` where `n` is the number
of nodes reachable from the node `object#relation` through `e` edges. Space
complexity is `O(n)`. Rearranged, both space and time complexity are `O(b^d)`
where `b` is the maximum breadth and `d` the maximum depth in the graph, seen
from the search root. [[1]](#references)

This means that the complexity heavily depends on the structure of the graph. If
it contains deeply nested indirections, it will require many recursive calls to
resolve those indirections. Analogously, if there are widely nested
indirections, Ory Keto has to possibly resolve all of them. The goal is to
design the ACL tuples in a way such that there are only view indirections to
resolve. Read more about that in our [ACL design guidelines](/TODO).

Because of this we decided that generic benchmarks will not yield any meaningful
result. We will therefore add a comparison with other similar projects later on.

## Expand Engine

Similar to how the check-engine traverses the graph of relationtuples, the
expand-engine builds the tree of all set operations it encounters. It resolves
all indirections starting at the requested subjectset up to the specified depth.
Because it also uses breadth-first search, time and space complexity linearly
depend on the nodes reachable from the requested subjectset. The same
performance considerations apply here, while it is important to note that
requesting a low depth will further limit the complexity of the operation. The
returned tree can also exceed reasonable size limits quickly if the
relationtuples are deeply and/or widely nested.
