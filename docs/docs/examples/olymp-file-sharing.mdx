RelationTuplePrism()

#### A basic, down-to-earth full feature example

Consider a file sharing application called "Olymp Library". Each file is stored
in a key-value store, where the key is a UUIDv4 (pseudorandom unique
identifier), while the value is the metadata and content. The application uses
Ory Keto to keep track of ownership and granted access on a per file level.

:::note

This example assumes there is a [namespace](../concepts/namespaces.mdx) `files`
with the relations `owner` and `access` defined, where each `owner` of an object
also has `access` to that object. All relation tuples are stored in that
namespace.

:::

Now, the user identified by its unique username `demeter` wants to upload a file
containing the most fertile grounds. The file gets assigned the UUID
`ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4`. The application adds the following
[relation tuple](../concepts/relation-tuples.mdx) to Ory Keto through the
[write API](../concepts/api-overview.mdx#write-apis):

```keto-relation-tuples
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#owner@demeter
```

To prepare for an important meeting with the user `athena`, `demeter` wants to
share the file with fertile grounds with `athena` so that they can both read it.
Therefore, he opens the "Olymp Library" and is presented with a list of all
files he owns. The application will internally request all
[objects](../concepts/objects.mdx) (file IDs) with the owner `demeter` by using
the [list API](../concepts/api-overview.mdx#list-relation-tuples). The response
will contain the object `ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4`, which the
application maps to the file in question.

The user `demeter` will then ask the application to share the file with
`athena`. The application will translate that request into a
[write API request](../concepts/api-overview.mdx#write-apis) adding the
following relation tuple to Ory Keto:

```keto-relation-tuples
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access@athena
```

To confirm the successful operation, the application uses Ory Keto's
[expand API](../concepts/api-overview.mdx#expand-subject-sets) to compile a list
of everyone who can access the file:

```keto-relation-tuples
// The following subject set is expanded by Keto
ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access
```

which returns the expansion tree

```
∪ ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#access
├─ ∪ ec788a82-a12e-45a4-b906-3e69f78c94e4#owner
│  ├─ ☘ demeter
├─ ☘ athena
```

The "Olymp Library" can then display this information to `demeter`.

When `athena` wants to get the file containing fertile grounds, the application
uses the [check API](../concepts/api-overview.mdx#check-relation-tuple) to
verify that `athena` has access to the file before it returns the file. This
will allow `demeter` to revoke `athena`'s access at any point by deleting the
corresponding relation tuple.
