## Introduction

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

_Please note_: We take ORY {{Project}}'s security and our users' trust very
seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in ORY {{Project}},
please responsibly disclose by contacting us at security@ory.sh.

First:
As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

If you are unsure, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving it your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in
the way of that.

That said, if you want to ensure that a pull request is likely to be merged,
talk to us! You can find out our thoughts and ensure that your contribution
won't clash or be obviated by ORY {{Project}}'s normal direction. A great way to
do this is via the [ORY Community](https://community.ory.sh/) or join the
[ORY Chat](https://www.ory.sh/chat).

## How can I contribute?

If you want to start contributing code right away, we have a [list of good first issues](https://github.com/ory/{{Project}}/labels/good%20first%20issue).

There are many other ways you can contribute without writing any code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

- **Give us a star.** It may not seem like much, but it really makes a difference. This is something that everyone can do to help out ORY {{Project}}. Github stars help the project gain visibility and stand out.

- **Join the community.** Sometimes helping people can be as easy as listening to their problems and offering a different perspective. Join our Slack, have a look at discussions in the forum and take part in our weekly hangout. More info on this in [Communication](#communication).

- **Helping with open issues.**
  We have a lot of open issues for ORY {{Project}} and some of them may lack necessary information, some are duplicates of older issues. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.

- **Reviewing documentation changes.**
  Most documentation just needs a review for proper spelling and grammar. If you think a document can be improved in any way, feel free to hit the `edit` button at the top of the page. More info on contributing to documentation here.

- **Help with tests.**
  Some pull requests may lack proper tests or test plans. These are needed for the change to be implemented safely.

## Communication

We use [Slack](https://www.ory.sh/chat). You are welcome to drop in and ask
questions, discuss bugs and feature requests, talk to other users of ORY, etc.

We have a [forum](https://community.ory.sh/). This is a great place for in-depth discussions and lots of code examples, logs and similar data.

You can also join our weekly hangout, if you want to speak to the ORY team directly or ask some questions. You can find more info on the hangouts in [Slack](https://www.ory.sh/chat).

If you want to receive regular notifications about updates to ORY {{Project}}, consider joining the mailing list. We will _only_ send you vital information on the projects that you are interested in.

Also [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/orycorp).

## Contributing Code

Unless you are fixing a known bug, we **strongly** recommend discussing it with
the core team via a GitHub issue or [in our chat](https://www.ory.sh/chat)
before getting started to ensure your work is consistent with ORY {{Project}}'s
roadmap and architecture.

All contributions are made via pull request. Note that **all patches from all
contributors get reviewed**. After a pull request is made other contributors
will offer feedback, and if the patch passes review a maintainer will accept it
with a comment. When pull requests fail testing, authors are expected to update
their pull requests to address the failures until the tests pass and the pull
request merges successfully. Look here for more info on the [Pull request procedure](#pull-request-procedure).

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches
from maintainers).

Before your contributions can be merged you need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/ory/).

This agreement defines the terms under which your code is contributed to ORY.
More specifically it declares that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. You can see the Apache 2.0 license under
which our projects are published [here](https://github.com/ory/meta/blob/master/LICENSE).

Reviewers should leave a "LGTM" comment once they are satisfied with the patch.
If the patch was submitted by a maintainer with write access, the pull request
should be merged by the submitter after review.

## Documentation

Please provide documentation when changing, removing, or adding features.
Documentation resides in the project's [docs](docs) folder. Generate API and
configuration reference documentation using `cd docs; npm run gen`.

For further instructions please head over to [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Disclosing vulnerabilities

Please disclose vulnerabilities exclusively to
[security@ory.sh](mailto:security@ory.sh). Do not use GitHub issues.

## Code Style

Please follow these guidelines when formatting source code:

- Go code should match the output of `gofmt -s` and pass `golangci-lint run`.
- NodeJS and JavaScript code should be prettified using `npm run format` where
  appropriate.

## Pull request procedure

To make a pull request, you will need a GitHub account; if you are unclear on
this process, see GitHub's documentation on
[forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull
requests should be targeted at the `master` branch. Before creating a pull
request, go through this checklist:

1. Create a feature branch off of `master` so that changes do not get mixed up.
1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local
   changes against the `master` branch.
1. Run the full project test suite with the `go test ./...` (or equivalent)
   command and confirm that it passes.
1. Run `gofmt -s` (if the project is written in Go).
1. Ensure that each commit has a subsystem prefix (ex: `controller:`).

Pull requests will be treated as "review requests," and maintainers will give
feedback on the style and substance of the patch.

Normally, all pull requests must include tests that test your change.
Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test for. In those cases,
please include a note in your commit message explaining why.

### Working with Forks

```
# First you clone the original repository
git clone git@github.com:ory/{{Project}}.git

# Next you add a git remote that is your fork:
git remote add fork git@github.com:<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE>/{{Project}}.git

# Next you fetch the latest changes from origin for master:
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull --rebase

# Next you create a new feature branch off of master:
git checkout my-feature-branch

# Now you do your work and commit your changes:
git add -A
git commit -a -m "fix: this is the subject line" -m "This is the body line. Closes #123"

# And the last step is pushing this to your fork
git push -u fork my-feature-branch
```

Now go to the project's GitHub Pull Request page and click "New pull request"
