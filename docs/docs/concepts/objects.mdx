Objects are identifiers for some kind of application objects. They can represent
e.g. a file, network port, physical item, ... . It is up to the application to
map its objects to an unambiguous identifier. We recommend the usage of UUIDs as
they provide a high entropy and thus unique identifiers. It is however possible
to use e.g. URLs or opaque tokens of any kind. Please check the
[limitations](#advanced-example-using-application-information-within-keto-objects).
Ory Keto will consider objects equal iff their string representation is equal.

## Basic Example

In the basic case an application uses the same object identifiers as it uses
internally, e.g. a UUIDv4 like `61e75133-efff-4281-8148-a1806919f568` or SHA-1
hash like `5c6f593a4e12970d647843f97846fd5ed18179eb`.

[basic full feature example](../examples/olymp-file-sharing.mdx) to see an
example with some context.

## Advanced Example: Using Application Information within Keto Objects

Because the Keto client can use arbitrary strings as objects, it is tempting to
encode application data within the object. **We strongly discourage this
practice.** Instead, you should use a UUID to map application data to Keto
objects. This has a view advantages:

| Advantage                                     | Keto's Limitation                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| control the encoding of data                  | rejects the delimiters `:#@`                                              |
| control the size of data                      | allows only up to 64 characters                                           |
| single source of truth <br/> easy data update | stores relation tuples independently of each other <br/> no global update |

For example, this could be used to implement checks on value ranges. The
application knows the following mapping of comparison conditions and UUIDs:

```yml
f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d:
  greater_than: 5

c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6:
  greater_than: 2
  smaller_equal: 5
```

Keto has the following relation tuples:

```keto-relation-tuples
// Members of the admins group are allowed to set a value v > 5
values:f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d#set_value@(groups:admins#member)

// Members of the devs group are allowed to set a value v: 2 < v <= 5
values:c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6#set_value@(groups:devs#member)

// Anyone who can set a value v > 5 can also set 2 < v <= 5
values:c4540cf5-6ac4-4007-910b-c5a56aa3d4e6#set_value@(values:f832e1e7-3c97-4cb8-8582-979e63ae2f1d#set_value)
```

The application will have to translate an incoming "set value" request to the
corresponding condition the value fulfills. It is important to understand that
Ory Keto does **not** know how to interpret any of the information. Rather, the
application has to preprocess and map the value to the corresponding UUID.
