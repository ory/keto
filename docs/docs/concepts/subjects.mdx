In Ory Keto subjects are a recursive polymorphic datatype. They either refer to
a specific subject (e.g. user) by some application defined identifier, or a set
of subjects.

## Subject IDs

A subject ID can be any string. It is up to the application to map its users,
devices, ... to a constant, unique identifier. We recommend the usage of UUIDs
as they provide a high entropy. It is however possible to use e.g. URLs or
opaque tokens of any kind. Please check the
[limitations](#advanced-example-using-application-information-within-keto-subjects).
Ory Keto will consider subject IDs equal iff their string representation is
equal.

## Subject Sets

A subject set is the set of all subjects that have a specific relation on an
[object](./objects.mdx). They empower Ory Keto to be as flexible as you need it
by defining indirections. They can be used to realize e.g. [RBAC](/TODO) or
[inheritance of relations](/TODO). Subject sets themselves can again indirect to
subject sets. For a performant evaluation of requests it is however required to
follow some [best practices](../performance.mdx). As a special case, subject
sets can also refer to an object by using the empty relation. Effectively, this
is interpreted as "any relation, even a non-existent one".

Subject sets also represent all intermediary nodes in
[the graph of relations](./graph-of-relations.mdx).

## Basic Example

In the basic case an application uses the same subject identifiers as it uses
internally, e.g. a constant, unique username like `zepatrik` or preferably
UUIDv4 like `480158d4-0031-4412-9453-1bb0cdf76104`.

[basic full feature example](../examples/olymp-file-sharing.mdx) to see an
example with some context.

## Advanced Example: Using Application Information within Keto Subjects

Because the Keto client can use arbitrary strings as subjects, it is tempting to
encode application data within the subject. **We strongly discourage this
practice.** Instead, you should use a UUID to map application data to Keto
subjects. This is required to ensure:

1. single source of truth and easy data update
2. free choice of encoding (Keto does not allow the characters `:#@`)
3. unlimited data size (Keto only allows up to 64 characters)

For example, this can be used to implement a crude ABAC system by mapping
attributes to a subject ID. The application can then define relation tuples that
reflect permissions depending on the value of attributes. It will have to map
each request to the subject representing the attributes.

Let's assume the application knows the following mapping between attributes and
UUIDs:

```yml
c5b6454f-f79c-4a6d-9e1b-b44e04b56009:
  subnet: 192.168.0.0/24
  office_hours: true
```

Keto could then know the following relation tuple:

```keto-relation-tuples
// allow access to TCP port 22 when the request originates from a specific subnet during office hours
tcp/22#access@c5b6454f-f79c-4a6d-9e1b-b44e04b56009
```

The application has to map each incoming request to a subject string
representing the attributes of the request. Ory Keto will reply with a positive
[check response](./api-overview.mdx#check-relation-tuple) depending on the
string equality of the requested subject representing the attributes with the
known relation tuples. Remember that Ory Keto does **not** know how to interpret
any information stored in the relation tuples. Rather, the application has to
preprocess and map the value to the corresponding UUID.
