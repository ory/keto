title: APIs Overview
---

This page gives an overview over all APIs Ory Keto offers, including common use
cases.

The APIs are separated based on privileges into a `read` and `write` endpoint.
Each endpoint is exposed on a different port, so you can decide how to restrict
access. REST and gRPC connections are multiplexed on the same port.

All APIs are available to REST and gRPC clients, although feature parity is not
always given. Because we follow REST and gRPC best practices and design
guidelines, the APIs offer slightly different interfaces and capabilities.

## Read APIs

The read-APIs are per default exposed on the TCP port `4466`.

### List Relation Tuples

This API allows you to query [relation tuples](./relation-tuples.mdx) by
partially providing a tuple. It can be used to:

- [list object a user has access to](../guides/list-api-display-objects.mdx)
- list users who have a specific role
- list users who are members of a specific group
- audit permissions in the system

For more details, head over to the
[gRPC API reference](../reference/proto-api.mdx#readservice) or
[REST API reference](../reference/api.mdx#TODO).

### Check Relation Tuple

The check-API allows you to check whether a subject has a relation on an object.
This API resolves [subject sets](./subjects.mdx#subject-sets) and
[subject set rewrites](https://github.com/ory/keto/issues/263).

This API is primarily used to
[check permissions to restrict actions](../guides/simple-access-check-guide.mdx).

For more details, head over to the
[gRPC API reference](../reference/proto-api.mdx#checkservice) or
[REST API reference](../reference/api.mdx#TODO).

### Expand Subject Sets

The expand-API recursively expands a [subject set](./subjects.mdx#subject-sets)
into a tree of subjects. For each subject, the tree assembles the relation
tuples including the operands as defined in the
[namespace configuration](./namespaces.mdx). It can be used to:

- [list who has access to an object](../guides/expand-api-display-who-has-access.mdx)
- determine why someone has access to an object
- audit permissions in the system

An expand-request has to include the maximum depth of the tree to be returned.
This is required to ensure low latency and limit the resource usage per request.

[performance considerations](../performance.mdx).

[gRPC API reference](../reference/proto-api.mdx#expandservice) or
[REST API reference](../reference/api.mdx#TODO).

## Write APIs

The write-APIs are per default exposed on the TCP port `4467`.

### Change Relation Tuples

The write-APIs offer multiple ways to insert and delete relation tuples. Please
head over to the [gRPC API reference](../reference/proto-api.mdx#writeservice)
or [REST API reference](../reference/api.mdx#TODO) to read more about the
available methods for each client type.

In general, it is preferred to use the transaction based methods over repeatedly
calling simple methods for bulk updates. This is not only because they provide
stronger consistency guarantees, but also because the database usually handles a
single transaction with a lot of data faster than a lot of small transactions.

The main use cases for the write-APIs are:

- setting up permissions for a new object
- sharing an object with another user
- revoking access to an object
- transferring relations to an object to another user
