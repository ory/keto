Relation tuples are the underlying datatype of Ory Keto's access control
language. They encode relations between [objects](./objects) and
[subjects](./subjects). A relation tuple is associated with a
[namespace](./namespaces) where its relation has to be defined and configured.
The following BCNF grammar describes the encoding used in the documentation and
within Ory Keto. Note that the namespace is often omitted in examples for
readability, but is technically always required.

```
<relation-tuple> ::= <object>'#'relation'@'<subject>
<object> ::= namespace':'object_id
<subject> ::= subject_id | <subject_set>
<subject_set> ::= <object>'#'relation
```

A relation tuple

```keto-relation-tuples
object#relation@subject
```

can be translated into the english sentence "Subject has relation on object".

## Effect of a Relation Tuple

The effect of a relation tuple is the effect of its relation as defined in the
[namespace configuration](/TODO). It can be one of union (boolean or),
intersection (boolean and), or exclusion (boolean not).
