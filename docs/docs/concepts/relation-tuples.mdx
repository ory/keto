Relation tuples are the underlying datatype of Ory Keto's access control
language. They encode relations between [objects](./objects.mdx) and
[subjects](./subjects.mdx). A relation tuple is associated with a
[namespace](./namespaces.mdx) where its relation has to be defined and
configured. The following
[BNF grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) describes
the encoding used in the documentation and within Ory Keto.

:::note

The namespace is often omitted in examples for readability, but is technically
always required.

:::

```
<relation-tuple> ::= <object>'#'relation'@'<subject>
<object> ::= namespace':'object_id
<subject> ::= subject_id | <subject_set>
<subject_set> ::= <object>'#'relation
```

A relation tuple

```keto-relation-tuples
object#relation@subject
```

can be translated into the english sentence "Subject has relation on object".

## Effect of a Relation Tuple

The effect of a relation tuple is the effect of its relation as defined in the
[namespace configuration](/TODO). It can be one of union (boolean or),
intersection (boolean and), or exclusion (boolean not).
