The [relation tuples](./relation-tuples) of the ACL used by Ory Keto can be
represented as a graph of relations. This graph will help us to understand many
[implications on performance](../performance) and [internal algorithms](/TODO).

## Definition

:::note

This concept page omits the [namespace](./namespaces) from all data to reduce
the amount of information. In practice, the namespace always has to be
considered.

:::

The graph consists of three types of nodes. [Object](./objects) nodes that
represent application objects, intermediary [subject set](./subjects) nodes, and
[subject ID](./subjects) nodes representing individuals. The edges are directed
and represent the relation between an object and subject. The following example
translates a view relation tuples into the corresponding graph of relations.

```keto-relation-tuples
dir1#access@user1
// Have a look on the subjects concept page if you don't know the empty relation.
dir1#parent@(file1#)
// Everyone with access to dir1 has access to file1. This would probably be defined
// through a subject set rewrite that defines access to everyone who has access to
// the parent. In this example we define this tuple explicitly.
file1#access@(dir1#access)
// Direct access on file2 was granted.
file2#access@user1
// user2 is owner of file2
file2#owner@user2
// Owners of file2 have access to it; possibly defined through subject set rewrites.
file2#access@(file2#owner)
```

This is represented by the following graph:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
graph TD
    subgraph obj [Object region]
    A[file1]
    E[dir1] -->|parent| A
    G[file2]
    end
    subgraph subjID [Subject ID region]
    F([user1])
    C([user2])
    end
    A -->|access| B{{dir1#access}}
    B -. file1#access .-> F
    E -->|access| F
    G -->|access| F
    G -->|owner| C
    G -->|access| H{{file2#owner}}
    H -. file2#access .-> C
`}
/>

Solid edges represent explicitly defined relations, while dotted edges represent
relations inherited from a subject set.

## Observations about the Graph

Ory Keto utilizes the following key properties of the graph of relations:

1. **Directed edges from objects to subjects**: This implies a neat arrangement
   with objects in one region, subject IDs in another one, and subject sets in
   between. Edges will always go from the object region towards the subject
   region.
2. **Searching for a possible path is local**: Trying to find a path from an
   object to a subject will always happen locally. It is only necessary to
   traverse the nodes that are successors of the object. In typical setups, this
   means that only a small fraction of the graph has to be searched, regardless
   of the outcome. The intuition here is that the relations of user1's files are
   irrelevant when checking access to user2's files.

Both of these properties are important to ensure a [performant]
