RelationTuplePrism()

Ory Keto knows the concept of namespaces to organize
[relation tuples](./relation-tuples). Namespaces have a configuration that
defines the relations, and some other important values ([see reference](/TODO)).
Unlike other applications, Ory Keto does **not** isolate namespaces. Especially,
[subject sets](./subjects) can cross-reference from one namespace to another.
The namespaces' purpose is to split up the data into coherent partitions, each
with its corresponding configuration. Internally each namespace has its own
table in the database to allow setting individual
[storage specific options](/TODO).

## Scoping of Objects

The application can also use namespaces to scope [objects](./objects) because
Ory Keto only compares objects within a namespace. For example, if Ory Keto
knows the following relation tuples

```keto-relation-tuples
// user1 has acces to the directory foo
directories:foo#access@user1
// user2 has access to the file foo
files:foo#access@user2
```

both of the following [check](/TODO) requests

```keto-relation-tuples
// Does user2 have access to the directory foo?
directories:foo#access@user2
// Does user1 have access to the file foo?
files:foo#access@user1
```

will evaluate to false (a.k.a. rejected).

Vice versa, all relation tuples containing an object have to be in the same
namespace to reference the same object.

## Migrations

Because namespaces each come with an individual configuration that can even
modify some storage specific options, it is required to manually review and run
migrations on namespace configuration updates. Please refer to the
[namespace migration CLI reference](/TODO) and
[running in production guide](/TODO) to learn more about that process.
