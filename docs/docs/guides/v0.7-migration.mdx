title: Migrating to Keto v0.7
---

Ory Keto v0.6 used the table-separated namespaces database schema described in
the [Google Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). However, we
found for various reasons outlined in
[#613](https://github.com/ory/keto/issues/613) that this is not ideal for Keto.

Because the database schema changed significantly, and it is not possible to
have SQL-only migrations, there is a special migration procedure needed to
upgrade Ory Keto v0.6.

## Preparations

:::danger

As always with database migrations, please make a backup of your data and try
the migration process first on a non-production copy of the database.

:::

This migration has to download all the data from the database, transform them,
and then write them back to the database. Make sure that you run it as close to
the database as possible to reduce the latency and failure rate. In case of a
failure, just restart the process. It is run as one big SQL transaction.

## Recommended Procedure

:::caution

This is the **recommended** procedure. Please adjust to your setup and **test**
before applying to a production system. You might want to create a migration
script that applies all these steps and handles errors.

:::

This procedure is zero-downtime only for read API requests. The write API will
not be available during migration.

1. Create a new database user (from now on `keto_new`) with the same privileges
   as the one used until now (let's say it was `keto`).
2. Start a server instance of Keto v0.7 next to the already running Keto v0.6.
   It should have the same settings, but use `keto_new` for accessing the
   database.
3. Change the privileges of `keto` to be read-only on all tables.
4. Still route all traffic to the old Keto. Write API requests will fail from
   now on, but the Read API will be zero-downtime.
5. Run `keto namespace migrate legacy --yes` considering the points raised in
   [#Preparations].
6. In case of failure, re-run the command until it succeeds.
7. In case of log statements stating
   `Skipping relation tuple, it seems to be in a broken state. Please recreate it manually.`
   note down the logged data somewhere and recreate the relation tuples in
   question once the migration is done using the API.
8. After the migration is successfully done, route all traffic to Keto v0.7 and
   shut down Keto v0.6. At this point the API is fully operational again.
