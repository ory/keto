In this guide you will learn how to use Ory Keto's list API to display a list of
all objects (e.g. files, ...) a user has access to. Please refer to the
[gRPC](../reference/proto-api.mdx) and [REST](../reference/api.mdx) API
reference documentation for all details. In general, the list API allows you to
query relation tuples based on partial relation tuples.

## Example

As an example, we want to look at a chat application. Every user is part of one
or more chats, and each chat has one or more members.

Chats are stored in Ory Keto within the `chats` namespace. They are identified
by a UUID that the application maps to the actual object metadata. Users are
also identified by and mapped to a UUID.

:::info

For the sake of readability, the code samples use the name of the chat and
username instead of the UUIDs. Please refer to the
[objects](../concepts/objects.mdx) and [subjects](../concepts/subjects.mdx)
pages for why the mapping is necessary.

### Listing Objects

Our example application allows users to browse the chats they belong to. To
achieve that, it uses Ory Keto's list API.

We assume that the application currently has the following chats:

```yml
memes:
  members:
    - PM
    - Vincent
    - Julia
cars:
  members:
    - PM
    - Julia
coffee-break:
  members:
    - PM
    - Vincent
    - Julia
    - Patrik
```

This is represented in Ory Keto by the following
[relation tuples](../concepts/relation-tuples.mdx):

```keto-relation-tuples
chats:memes#member@PM
chats:memes#member@Vincent
chats:memes#member@Julia

chats:cars#member@PM
chats:cars#member@Julia

chats:coffee-break#member@PM
chats:coffee-break#member@Vincent
chats:coffee-break#member@Julia
chats:coffee-break#member@Patrik
```

The user `PM` now opens the chat application. To display a list of all of `PM`'s
chats, the application uses Keto's list API:

<CodeTabs sampleId="list-api-display-objects/01-list-PM" version="zanzibar" />

As a response, the application gets the list of all chats the user `PM` is a
member of. It can then use the information to build the UI.

### Listing Subjects

Another view of the chat application has to display all members of a specific
group to the user. This can also be achieved using the list API. In cases where
such a membership would be modeled through
[subject sets](../concepts/subjects.mdx#subject-sets), you have to use the
[expand API](./expand-api-display-who-has-access.mdx).

:::caution

In this case the application should probably first use the
[check API](./simple-access-check-guide.mdx) to check whether the user is
allowed to list the members of a group. This step is not part of this example.

:::

In our example, a user wants to see who is a member of the `coffee-break` group:

<CodeTabs
  sampleId="list-api-display-objects/02-list-coffee-break"
  version="zanzibar"
/>

## Application Context

It is important to note that the list API does **not** expand
[subject sets](../concepts/subjects.mdx#subject-sets). Usually the application
has some context to determine what tuples to query anyway. That could be e.g.
knowledge of the structure of subject sets like depth or hierarchy, or the UI
context, like a "My Items" view which should probably contain other objects than
a "My Organizations" or "Shared with Me" views. If there really is no way to
narrow down a query, you will have to use the
[expand API](./expand-api-display-who-has-access) instead, or repeatedly call
the list API. Try to avoid such cases because they require a lot of resources
and can quickly degrade the service quality for all users. Please refer to the
[performance considerations](../performance.mdx).

## Pagination

The list API only returns paginated results. Currently, it is not possible to
customize the order of results. The response returns an opaque token that has to
be used to retrieve the following page. The first page can be retrieved by
passing no, or an empty token.

The page size can be adjusted at any point, not only when requesting the first
page. It defaults to 100 items.
