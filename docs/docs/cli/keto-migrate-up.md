## keto migrate up

Migrate the database up

### Synopsis

Run this command on a fresh SQL installation and when you upgrade Ory Keto from
version v0.7.x and later.

It is recommended to run this command close to the SQL instance (e.g. same
subnet) instead of over the public internet. This decreases risk of failure and
decreases time required.

### WARNING

Before running this command on an existing database, create a back up!

```
keto migrate up [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --format string   Set the output format. One of table, json, and json-pretty. (default &#34;default&#34;)
  -h, --help            help for up
  -q, --quiet           Be quiet with output printing.
  -y, --yes             yes to all questions, no user input required
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config strings   Config files to load, overwriting in the order specified. (default [/home/circleci/keto.yml])
```
