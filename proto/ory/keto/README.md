# Notes

> ORY Keto is still a `sandbox` project and
the included APIs are unstable until we reach `v1` 
and release `v1.0.0` of Keto!
>
> Older API versions, such as `v1alpha1`, will still
> get support for a reasonable amount of time after release
> of `v1`!

This directory contains the ProtoBuf & gRPC definitions
for the Access Control APIs.

**ACL is the flexible and scalable "base system"
all other access control schemes built upon.**
