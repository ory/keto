This service is a policy decision point. It uses a set of access control policies, similar to
[AWS IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), in order to determine whether
a subject (user, application, service, car, ...) is authorized to perform a certain action on a resource.

## Introduction

With ORY Keto, you can model Access Control Lists, Role Based Access Control, and fine-grained permission sets.
This server implementation uses [ORY Ladon](https://github.com/ory/ladon) as the decision engine.

ORY Keto is possible to resolve credentials using various authentication mechanisms:

* OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens using the OAuth 2.0 Introspection standard.
* Plaintext when you already know the user ID.
* JSON Web Tokens (coming soon).
* SAML (coming soon).

## Installation

The easiest way to install ORY Keto is using the [Docker Hub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/keto/):

```
docker run oryd/keto:<version> help
```

### ORY Security Console: Administrative User Interface

The [ORY Security Console](https://console.ory.am/auth/login) is a visual admin interface for managing ORY Hydra,
ORY Oathkeeper, and ORY Keto.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server optimized
for low-latency, high throughput, and low resource consumption. ORY Hydra is not an identity provider
(user sign up, user log in, password reset flow), but connects to your existing identity provider through a consent app.

### ORY Oathkeeper: Identity & Access Proxy

[ORY Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a BeyondCorp/Zero Trust Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) built
on top of OAuth2 and ORY Hydra.
