This service is a policy decision point. It uses a set of access control policies, similar to
[AWS IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), in order to determine whether
a subject, for example user, application, service, car, etc., is authorized to perform a certain action on a resource.

## Introduction

ORY Keto is an permission server that implements best practice access control mechanisms:

* Available today:
  * ORY-flavored Access Control Policies with exact, glob, and regexp matching strategies
* Available soon:
  * [Access Control Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
  * [Role Based Access Control](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Based_Access_Control)
  * Role Based Access Control with Context (Google/Kubernetes-flavored)
  * Amazon Web Services Identity & Access Management Policies (AWS IAM Policies)

Each mechanism is powered by a decision engine implemented on top of the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) and provides well-defined management and authorization endpoints.

### Installation

There are various ways of installing ORY Keto on your system.

#### 1. Download binaries

The client and server **binaries are downloadable at [releases](https://github.com/ory/keto/releases)**.
There is no installer yet available. Add the ORY keto binary to the PATH environment variable or add
the binary to a location already in your path (`/usr/bin`, ...).
If these download instructions are unclear, ask for clarification in our [chat channel](https://www.ory.sh/chat). We are happy to help.

#### 2. Using Docker

**Starting the host** is easiest with Docker. The host process handles HTTP requests and is backed by a database.
Read how to install docker on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/), [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) or
[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/). ORY keto is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oryd/keto/).

When using ORY keto without a database, restarting, scaling
or stopping the container will **lose all data**:

```
$ docker run -e "DATABASE_URL=memory" -d --name my-keto -p 4466:4466 oryd/keto
ec91228cb105db315553499c81918258f52cee9636ea2a4821bdb8226872f54b
```

#### Building from source

If you wish to compile ORY Keto, install and set up [Go 1.11+](https://golang.org/).

The following commands check out the latest ORY keto's release tag, compile it and set up flags so that `keto version`
works as expected. Please note that this will only work with a linux shell like bash or sh.

```
go get -u github.com/ory/keto
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ory/keto
make install-stable
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/keto help
```

## Ecosystem

<a href="https://console.ory.sh/">
    <img align="right" width="30%" src="docs/images/sec-console.png" alt="ORY Security Console">
</a>

### ORY Security Console: Administrative User Interface

The [ORY Security Console](https://console.ory.sh/) is a visual admin interface for ORY Hydra,
ORY Oathkeeper, and ORY Keto.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server optimized
for low-latency, high throughput, and low resource consumption. ORY Hydra is not an identity provider, which would include 
user sign up, user log in, password reset flow. Hydra but connects to your existing identity provider through a consent app.

### ORY Oathkeeper: Identity & Access Proxy

[ORY Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a BeyondCorp/Zero Trust Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) built
on top of OAuth2 and ORY Hydra.

### Examples

The [ory/examples](https://github.com/ory/examples) repository contains numerous examples of setting up this project and combining it with other services from the ORY Ecosystem.

## Security

### Disclosing vulnerabilities

If you think you found a security vulnerability, please refrain from posting it publicly on the forums, the chat, or GitHub
and send us an email to [hi@ory.am](mailto:hi@ory.am) instead.

## Telemetry

Our services collect summarized, anonymized data which can optionally be turned off. Click
[here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/master/telemetry/) to learn more.

### Guide

The Guide is available [here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/master/keto/).

### HTTP API documentation

The HTTP API is documented [here](https://www.ory.sh/docs/api/keto?version=master).

### Upgrading and Changelog

New releases might introduce breaking changes. To help you identify and incorporate those changes, we document these
changes in [UPGRADE.md](./UPGRADE.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Command line documentation

Run `keto -h` or `keto help`.
