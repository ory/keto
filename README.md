## Introduction

ORY Keto is a permission server that implements best practice access control mechanisms:

- Available today:
  - ORY-flavored Access Control Policies with exact, glob, and regexp matching strategies
- Available soon:
  - [Access Control Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
  - [Role Based Access Control](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Based_Access_Control)
  - Role Based Access Control with Context (Google/Kubernetes-flavored)
  - Amazon Web Services Identity & Access Management Policies (AWS IAM Policies)

Each mechanism is powered by a decision engine implemented on top of the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) and provides well-defined management and authorization endpoints.

### Installation

Head over to the documentation to learn about ways of [installing ORY Keto](https://www.ory.sh/docs/next/keto/install).

## Ecosystem

    <img align="right" width="30%" src="docs/images/sec-console.png" alt="ORY Security Console">
</a>

### ORY Security Console: Administrative User Interface

The [ORY Security Console](https://console.ory.sh/) is a visual admin interface for ORY Hydra,
ORY Oathkeeper, and ORY Keto.

### ORY Hydra: OAuth2 & OpenID Connect Server

[ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) ORY Hydra is a hardened OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server optimized
for low latency, high throughput, and low resource consumption. ORY Hydra is not an identity provider, which would include
user sign up, user log in, or password reset flow. Hydra connects to your existing identity provider through a consent app.

### ORY Oathkeeper: Identity & Access Proxy

[ORY Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a BeyondCorp/Zero Trust Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) built
on top of OAuth2 and ORY Hydra.

### Examples

The [ory/examples](https://github.com/ory/examples) repository contains numerous examples of setting up this project and combining it with other services from the ORY Ecosystem.
